# Controlling a lamp
---
## Project Overview
### This project is an IoT-based solution that enables users to control a lamp using their smartphones. By leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT), individuals can conveniently switch the lamp on or off remotely. This project serves as an educational resource for beginners, offering insights into IoT concepts and practical implementation.


# About IOT
###  **What is IoT?** The Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses the idea of connecting everyday physical objects or "things" to the internet, enabling them to send and receive data. These objects can include a wide range of items such as household appliances, wearables, vehicles, and industrial equipment. IoT enables these objects to communicate, collect data, and perform automated actions without human intervention. It holds the potential to enhance convenience, efficiency, and productivity in various domains of our lives.

# Technologies
## This project utilizes the following technologies:
### This project is built using the following technologies:
- **Arduino IDE**:  Arduino IDE is an open-source integrated development environment used for writing and uploading code to Arduino boards. In this project, we write code using the Arduino IDE in the C++ programming language..
- **Adafruit IO**: Adafruit IO is an IoT platform that simplifies the integration and control of connected devices. We leverage Adafruit IO to facilitate turning the lamp on/off and controlling its brightness remotely.
- **Nodemcu ESP8266**: The NodeMCU ESP8266 board is a popular and versatile choice for IoT projects. It provides a reliable hardware platform for connecting devices to the internet and exchanging data.
