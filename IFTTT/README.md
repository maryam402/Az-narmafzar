#IFTTT Code Explanation

To control the lamp from a Telegram bot using Adafruit IO, you need to add a "config.h" file. This file contains two settings for connecting to your Adafruit IO account:
1.IO_USERNAME: Set this to your Adafruit IO username.
2.IO_KEY: Set this to your Adafruit IO key. You can find these credentials in your Adafruit account.
To connect to the internet, you need to configure the following settings:
1. WIFI_SSID: Set this to the SSID (name) of your Wi-Fi network.
2. WIFI_PASS:  Set this to the password of your Wi-Fi network. Note that if you are using a free network, leave this field empty.
