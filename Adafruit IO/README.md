# Adafruit IO Code Explanation

To control the lamp through your Adafruit IO account, it is necessary to include a "config.h" file. This file comprises two settings for establishing a connection to your Adafruit IO account:
1.IO_USERNAME: Set this to your Adafruit IO username.
2.IO_KEY: Set this to your Adafruit IO key. You can locate these credentials in your Adafruit account.
To establish an internet connection, configure the following settings:
1. WIFI_SSID: Set this to the SSID (name) of your Wi-Fi network.
2. WIFI_PASS: Set this to the password of your Wi-Fi network. If you are using a free network, leave this field empty.
